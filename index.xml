Determine appropriate reef-pi version based on raspberry pi (3 or zero) from the release page. Choose latest relase if you are unsure. For this documentation we&amp;rsquo;ll use 1.0 release version on pi zero.
Open a terminal window using the ssh software of your choices. SSH into your raspberry pi, then login into reef-pi and upgrade by entering the following commands in the terminal window</description></item><item><title>Circuit construction</title><link>https://reef-pi.github.io/guides/electronics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reef-pi.github.io/guides/electronics/</guid><description>For almost all features of reef-pi that can be used to do anything on a reef tank, we&amp;rsquo;ll need additional electronic component other than just Raspberry Pi. This guide will walk through some key aspects and recommendations of wiring different electronic component together to build a functional reef-pi controller. Users who are well versed in electronics can skip this
Factors that influence circuit work Controller features reef-pi can automate a host of different reef keeping chores, and each of them may require one or more electronic component just for that feature.</description></item><item><title>Enclosure construction</title><link>https://reef-pi.github.io/guides/housing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reef-pi.github.io/guides/housing/</guid><description>Housing or fixture or enclosure provides physical safety to reef-pi electronics and is a must-have for any permanent installation. Housing or enclosure secures the electronics from outside environment, as well as provides a mounting place for the different probes, equipment and display panels. There are many ways one can build housing for reef-pi. Couple of things to consider:
Size Depending on what all features you want to use in reef-pi, ensure the housing can accommodate all parts.</description></item><item><title>Safety</title><link>https://reef-pi.github.io/additional-documentation/safety/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reef-pi.github.io/additional-documentation/safety/</guid><description>A typical reef-pi build involves both water and electricity, this can be potentially hazerdous. Please ensure safety consideration for yourself and all the living things in your tank. If you are working with electronics, especially with water and high voltage together, it can be dangerous. This page is intended to inform you about this risk. It is not high voltage but high current that imposes risk. High current here stands for milliamps.</description></item><item><title>Remote Access</title><link>https://reef-pi.github.io/additional-documentation/remote/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reef-pi.github.io/additional-documentation/remote/</guid><description>This guide meant to assist in establishing a remote connection to your reef-pi main control page using one of the two popular options, RealVNC and Tor. reef-pi is normally accessible only within the home wifi network, using any of these two approaches you can access reef-pi from anywhere.
RealVNC The first option is to use software such as Real VNC. They offer a cloud option that will allow you to access your Raspberry Pi from anywhere.</description></item><item><title>Glossary</title><link>https://reef-pi.github.io/additional-documentation/glossary/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reef-pi.github.io/additional-documentation/glossary/</guid><description>0-10v A method of diming leds using voltage.

Telemetry functionality help in avoiding tank accidents due to equipment failure (such as a bad heater cooking up a reef tank) or to understand long-term trends in tank parameters. This guide will walk through the basic telemetry features and how to configure them. This guide assumes you have a running reef-pi controller already. Follow the general guides first if you do not have a working reef-pi installation.</description></item><item><title>Values</title><link>https://reef-pi.github.io/additional-documentation/values/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reef-pi.github.io/additional-documentation/values/</guid><description>reef-pi project has three core values: affordable, modular and extensible. These are the guiding force behind key decisions and development strategies. This section of the documentation details how reef-pi project interpretes these values
Affordable Prefer easy to source parts. Be frugal, encourage salvaging older electronics component. Encourage user specific hacks and workaround that may significantly lower the build cost or time. Safety and reliability of the controller is not a yes or no question, its a compromise and we only encourage the current best practices.</description></item><item><title>Headless</title><link>https://reef-pi.github.io/additional-documentation/headless/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reef-pi.github.io/additional-documentation/headless/</guid><description>There are times when you want to get your Raspberry Pi up and running completely headlessly. Maybe you typically use a laptop and don&amp;rsquo;t have an extra keyboard. Maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t have an easy way to connect to an HDMI monitor. This guide will show you how you to set up your Pi to be completely headless. This will allow your Pi to connect to your wireless network and connect via SSH on its first boot.</description></item><item><title>Tools</title><link>https://reef-pi.github.io/additional-documentation/tools/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reef-pi.github.io/additional-documentation/tools/</guid><description>reef-pi installation and configuration HDMI cable and monitor or TV USB based keyboard and mouse USB TTL Cable A computer with SD card reader Wiring and testing electronics soldering iron, solder, faux etc. plier wire stripper Screw driver (philips, m8 etc) multimeter Wood working Dremel or some other rotary tools Scroll saw Clamps</description></item><item><title>Development environment</title><link>https://reef-pi.github.io/additional-documentation/development/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reef-pi.github.io/additional-documentation/development/</guid><description>reef-pi is written in go and react.
