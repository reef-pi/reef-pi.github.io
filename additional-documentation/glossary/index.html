Git is known as a &ldquo;distributed&rdquo; (rather than &ldquo;centralized&rdquo;) version control system because you can run it locally and disconnected from the Internet, and then &ldquo;push&rdquo; your changes to a remote system (such as GitHub) whenever you like.</p><h4 id=github>GitHub</h4><p>A version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.</p><h4 id=github-repository>GitHub Repository</h4><p>Both Git and GitHub refer to this as a repository, or repo for short, a digital directory or storage space where you can access your project, its files, and all the versions of its files that Git saves.</p><h4 id=jumpers>Jumpers</h4><p>Male to Female and/or Female to Female wires of varied lengths with pins or that can have pins soldered to them that are used to connect different components together on, to, or from a breadboard and/or the Pi.</p><h4 id=l293d>L293D</h4><p>A bridge motor driver transistor component used in the Dosing Controller build.</p><h4 id=pca9685-breakout-board>PCA9685 Breakout Board</h4><p>This board is a component used in the LED controller and Dosing Controller and possibly other builds.</p><h4 id=peristaltic-pump>Peristaltic Pump</h4><p>A component that pumps fluid and is used in the dosing controller build.</p><h4 id=photoelectric-water-level-sensor>Photoelectric Water Level Sensor</h4><p>A component that is used to sense the water level causing the ATO controller tell a pump to pump water.</p><h4 id=pn2222>PN2222</h4><p>A transistor that acts like a switch and is used in the LED controller build.</p><h4 id=power-socket-with-fuse>Power socket with fuse</h4><p>A 10 amp 250 volt (US) component used in the power controller and other builds.</p><h4 id=pull-or-pull-request>Pull or Pull Request</h4><p>When you open a pull request, youÂ’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches.</p><h4 id=push>Push</h4><p>Saves a local repository commit to a GitHub project.</p><h4 id=pwm>PWM</h4><p>Pulse Width Modulation - A method of diming leds current by pulsing current.</p><h4 id=raspberry-pi>Raspberry Pi</h4><p>A single board computer that is used in the Reef-pi controller. Depending on the requirements, a Pi zero or Pi B may be used instead of the Pi 3.</p><h4 id=raspberry-pi-7-touchscreen>Raspberry Pi 7&rdquo; Touchscreen</h4><p>The 7&rdquo; version of the official Raspberry Pi touchscreen. Other sizes are also available.</p><h4 id=reef-pi>reef-pi</h4><p>The software part of the reef tank controller based on the Raspberry Pi with software developed by Ranjib.</p><h4 id=relays>Relays</h4><p>Switches power to a another component on and off based on a signal from the Raspberry Pi and software logic. Both mechanical and solid state may be used, but the relay used it may vary the type of build or your requirements.</p><h4 id=repo>Repo</h4><p>See Github repository</p><h4 id=shell>Shell</h4><p>Shell is a user program or it&rsquo;s environment provided for user interaction. Shell is an command language interpreter that executes commands read from a keyboard or from a file.</p><h4 id=script>Script</h4><p>Shells are normally interactive, but if you use command one by one, then you can store this sequence of command to text file and tell the shell to execute this text file instead of entering the commands. This is known as shell script.</p><h4 id=submersible-water-pump>Submersible Water Pump</h4><p>A component used in the ATO Controller build.</p><h4 id=uln2803a>ULN2803a</h4><p>A DC motor driver component used in the ????
